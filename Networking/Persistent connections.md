# Persistent connections

---

HTTP/1.0 was limited, it allowed only one single request per TCP connection. When HTTP was developed, HTML documents usually consisted of the HTML file only, so the protocol was appropriate. As web pages grew to multimedia sites, one single page consisted of more than one document due to images, sounds, animations and so forth. A popular news web-site's index page today needs 150 different file requests to be displayed completely. Opening and closing a TCP connection for every request is slow. So the  "Connection: keep-alive" header field was developed, which would allow to reuse TCP connections, despite the fact that it was not part of the HTTP standard. HTTP/1.1 therefore officially introduced persistent connections and the Connection header field was adopted. By default a connection is now persistent unless specified otherwise. Once either partner does not wish to use the connection any longer, it will set the header field "Connection: close" to indicate the connection will be closed once the current request has been finished. Apache offers configuration directives to limit the amount of requests for one connection and a time-out value, after which any connection has to be closed when no further request is received.
