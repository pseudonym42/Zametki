# How to use images?

---

Images are templates for docker containers.

Some useful image related commands:

```
docker images            -> shows all images
docker import            -> creates an image from a tarball
docker build             -> creates image from Dockerfile
docker rmi               -> removes an image
docker system prune      -> removes dangling images, containers, volumes and networks

```
