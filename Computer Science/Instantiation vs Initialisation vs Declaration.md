# Instantiation vs Initialisation vs Declaration
---

### Declaration
This is when you state to the program that there will be an object and what the name of that object will be. For example in Javascript:

```Javascript
var x;
```

### Instantiation
This is when memory is allocated for an object. This is what for example in Java or JS happens when the “new” keyword is used. A reference to the object that was created is returned from the new keyword

### Initialisation
This is when values are put into the memory that was allocated during instantiation. This is what the constructor of a class does when using the “new” keyword.
